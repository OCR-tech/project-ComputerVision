# Computer Vision Projects

## Overview
This repository contains four computer vision modules that utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques covering a range of topics, including object detection, instance segmentation, and object tracking. 

## [Module 1: Deep Learning based Object Detection](M1_Deep_Learning_based_Object_Detection/README.md)
This module focuses on detecting objects in images using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how to use a pre-trained DNN Mobilenet architecture model for object detection using model inference.

## [Module 2: Object Detection using TensorFlow Hub](M2_Object_Detection_using_TensorFlow_Hub/README.md)
This module focuses on leveraging TensorFlow Hub to detect objects in images. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to use a pre-trained object detection EfficientDet D4 architecture model for object detection using model inference.

## [Module 3: Instance Segmentation with Mask RCNN](M3_Instance_Segmentation_with_Mask_RCNN/README.md)
This project focuses on classifying and segmenting objects in images using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Mask RCNN model for instance segmentation tasks. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the segmentation results.

## [Module 4: Object Tracking](M4_Object_Tracking/README.md)
This module focuses on tracking objects in video streams using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how to build an object tracking system using a pre-trained model. It includes a demonstration of the tracking system in action, showcasing its performance on real-time video streams.
