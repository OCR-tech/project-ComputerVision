# Module 1: Deep Learning based Object Detection

## Objectives:
- To detect objects using a pre-trained DNN Mobilenet architecture model

## Steps:
1. Download assets and check class labels
2. Model inference
    - Load a model and input image
    - Detect objects using a forward pass through the network
    - Display detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels

## Outcomes:
- The model can be used to detect objects in images and provide class labels and bounding boxes for each detected object
