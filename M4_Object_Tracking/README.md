Module 4: Object Tracking

## Objectives:
- To track objects using a tracker class for computer vision

## Steps:
1. Download assets
2. Create tracker instance
3. Read input video
4. Setup output video
5. Define bounding box
6. Initialize tracker
7. Read frame and track object

## Usages:
- Open in Colab and run the code
- Use the tracker class to track objects in real-time video streams

## Data:
- The dataset is downloaded from OpenCV (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

## Outcomes:
- The model can be used to detect objects in images and provide class labels and bounding boxes for each detected object
